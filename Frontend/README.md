# Equito Ping Pong Example Frontend

Welcome to the Equito Ping Pong Example Frontend repository! Its purpose is to demonstrate how to write a frontend application to interact with cross-chain decentralized applications built on Equito, the fastest cross-chain protocol. The documentation for this example can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.equito.network/tutorial/interface).

This application is written in TypeScript and built using [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). The [Equito SDK](https://github.com/equito-network/equito-sdk) is used to interact with Equito's cross-chain protocol, while [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) is used to interact with the EVM-compatible blockchains on which the example contracts are deployed.

The contracts for this example can be found in the [Equito EVM Contracts repository](https://github.com/equito-network/equito-evm-contracts/) for Foundry, or the [Equito Ping Pong Example repository](https://github.com/equito-network/equito-ping-pong-hardhat) for Hardhat.
